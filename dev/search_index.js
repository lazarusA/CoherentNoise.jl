CoherentNoise is a realization of their first Julia library, and as such, code may not be the most idiomatic in nature. However, it was a goal to produce something as Julian as possible, and with a focus on performance and precision, than to directly port the original Common Lisp implementation. If something can be improved in this regard, please open an issue or pull request – it would be wonderful if I could stengthen my Julia knowledge by discussion or contribution by more experienced Julia developers that find value in CoherentNoise.","category":"page"},{"location":"overview/#What's-different-from-other-libraries?","page":"Overview","title":"What's different from other libraries?","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"overview/","page":"Overview","title":"Overview","text":"Many more noise algorithms than libnoise supported, and well-tested.\nAlgorithms are consistently implemented in multiple dimensions, whereas libnoise only has 3-dimensional gradient noise.\nSome terminology corrections. For example, libnoise refers to multiple octaves of gradient noise as \"Perlin\" noise. Perlin is an implementation of gradient noise, and is not defined in terms of a fractal; infact, any noise algorithm can be \"fractalized\".\nFix quite a few fundamental mathematical errors. It was quite the task re-implementing some algorithms due to incorrect math, or the inclusion of magic numbers that differed among implementations for various reasons.\nEnsure that all samplers emit values in the [-1.0, 1.0] range; something that becomes very important when working with fractal-based noises, composition of complex noises, and in general is something just expected when working with coherent noise.\nThe Perlin noise implementation is Ken Perlin's \"Improved Noise\" algorithm, unlike his classic Perlin noise algorithm found in libnoise, which is sometimes just called gradient noise.\nFractal samplers can be driven by any source sampler, not just gradient noise – even other fractal samplers.\nAdditional modifier samplers.\nTraditional Simplex noise variants, even the original Simplex by Ken Perlin, all overshoot the radial extent used for the signal reconstruction kernel. This results in unwanted artifacts when the noise is used for certain applications. CoherentNoise adds an option to use a more correct kernel to remove these artifacts. This is disabled by default. See the documentation for the respective Simplex noise variant for more details. To the best of my knowledge, CoherentNoise is the only library that offers this option for all Simplex noise variants.","category":"page"},{"location":"overview/#How-is-it-used?","page":"Overview","title":"How is it used?","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"overview/","page":"Overview","title":"Overview","text":"In summary, you call a function corresponding to the coherent noise algorithm and dimensionality you want to generate, in order to create a \"sampler\".
